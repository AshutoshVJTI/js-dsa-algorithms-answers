## Course Overview

The course covers key concepts in algorithms and data structures using JavaScript, including:

- Problem-solving patterns
- Recursion
- Searching algorithms
- Sorting algorithms
- Data structures (e.g., Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, etc.)
- Dynamic programming
- And more...

This repo is intended to serve as a reference for anyone working through the course, showcasing completed coding exercises and implementations.

## Structure

Each section of the course is represented by a folder. Inside each folder, you'll find the JavaScript files corresponding to the coding exercises.

```
Section Name/
    Exercise1.js
    Exercise2.js
    ...
```

### Example Structure:

```
Section 5- Problem Solving Patterns/
    CodingExercise1.js
    CodingExercise2.js

Section 8- Recursion Problem Set/
    CodingExercise1.js
    CodingExercise2.js
```
